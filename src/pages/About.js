    <h1>About the #MyDearTeacher Movement</h1>

    <p><strong>Founded by UN Peace Ambassador and Educational Psychologist, Amb. Beauty Tommy</strong>, the #MyDearTeacher Movement is a global initiative dedicated to transforming how the world sees, supports, and celebrates neurodiverse learners. Rooted in equity, empathy, and empowerment, the movement advocates for inclusive education where every child feels seen, valued, and understood.</p>

    <p>What began as a heartfelt message in the bestselling book <em>Dear Teacher, I Am Not Broken</em> has grown into a global call for action—uniting educators, parents, policymakers, and communities around a shared goal: ensuring that no child is left behind because of how they learn.</p>

    <h2>🎯 Our Mission</h2>
    <p>To equip and inspire educators to teach with compassion and confidence, so all students—especially those with special educational needs—can thrive in inclusive, supportive environments.</p>

    <h2>👁 Our Vision</h2>
    <p>A future where no learner is labeled as broken, and every classroom becomes a place of belonging, growth, and possibility.</p>

    <h2>💡 What Inspired the Movement</h2>
    <p>The movement was born from real stories—of children misunderstood, of teachers overwhelmed, and of families seeking hope. Amb. Beauty Tommy’s experiences led to two powerful books that gave voice to the voiceless and inspired thousands of educators globally.</p>
